# Team Profile Generator

## Description
Even though creating a webpage for a team profile is a simple task, it can be bothersome and your team may be ready to begin more important work. The Team Profile Generator is a backend application that takes command line inputs and generates a simple HTML profile page for your team. It uses JavaScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Inquirer 8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to gather your information and  generate HTML. The HTML utilizes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) for styling, but the  style.css file also contains some custom stylings. This project employs the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) npm to run tests. See below for information on installing dependencies and commands to run tests.
